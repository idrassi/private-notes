## Installation

### Online Usage

No installation is required for online use. Simply visit the [live demo](https://notes.idrix.fr) to start managing your notes.

### Local Testing

To run Private Notes locally for testing purposes, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/idrassi/private-notes.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd private-notes
   ```

3. **Serve the Application**

   You can use any static server to serve the application. For example, using Python's built-in server:

   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

4. **Access the Application**

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

### Server Deployment

To deploy Private Notes on a server, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository to Your Server**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/idrassi/private-notes.git
   ```

2. **Configure HTTPS**

   Private Notes requires HTTPS to function correctly, especially for service workers and secure storage. Ensure your server is configured with a valid SSL certificate.

3. **Modify Configuration Files**

   - **`.htaccess` File**: The repository includes an `.htaccess` file with various configurations for Apache servers, including security headers and HTTPS enforcement. If you're not using an Apache server, you'll need to translate the `.htaccess` configurations to your server's configuration format. This includes setting up the correct security headers and HTTPS redirection.

   - **Update URLs**: Replace instances of `notes.idrix.fr` in the `.htaccess` file and `index.html` with your actual domain name.

     - In `.htaccess`, update the `Content-Security-Policy` header to reflect your domain.
     - In `index.html`, update any meta tags or links that reference `notes.idrix.fr`.

4. **Deploy Files to Server**

   Upload the application files to the appropriate directory on your web server.

5. **Restart Web Server**

   After making configuration changes, restart your web server to apply the new settings.

6. **Access the Application**

   Open your browser and navigate to your domain to access Private Notes.

## Technical Details

### Data Storage

- **IndexedDB**: Primary storage mechanism for notes, providing efficient and structured data management.
- **LocalStorage**: Automatic fallback if IndexedDB is not supported by the browser.

### Encryption

- **Key Derivation**: Uses PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with 1,000,000 iterations to derive a strong key from your password.
- **Encryption Algorithm**: Employs AES-GCM for encrypting note content, providing both confidentiality and integrity.
- **Salt and IV**: Generates unique random salt and initialization vector (IV) for each encrypted note.
- **Web Crypto API**: All cryptographic operations are performed using the browser's built-in Web Crypto API.

### Backup and Restore

- Notes can be exported and imported in JSON format.
- No external services are involved; all operations are performed locally.

### Security Headers

The application includes a `.htaccess` file configured with security headers to enhance security:

- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS.
- **Content Security Policy**: Restricts sources for scripts, styles, images, etc.
- **Referrer Policy**: Controls the information sent in the `Referer` header.
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing.
- **X-Frame-Options**: Protects against clickjacking.
- **Permissions Policy**: Disables unused features like geolocation and camera.

**Note**: If you're using a different web server, you'll need to adapt these configurations accordingly.

## Technologies Used
